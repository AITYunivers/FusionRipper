A work in progress, reimagining of CTFAK 2.0.

While only focusing on normal 2.5 games, it can also read MMF 2, TGF 2, and 2.5+. There's code for TGF 1.0 and MMF 1.5, they aren't finished and won't get you anything other than Pack Data.

2.5+ currently is not supported for MFA parsing.

This project aims to become a new Clickteam Fusion 2.5 decompiler with much cleaner code than the alternatives coded (mostly) from the ground up, along with MFA reading and CCN writing planned support from the start.

This project will not be updated very often and does not intend to replace CTFAK 2.0. If you'd like to decompile Clickteam Fusion 2.5 games, please use CTFAK 2.0.
