# SapphireD
A work in progress, reimagining of CTFAK 2.0.
This project currently only focuses on normal 2.5 games and can only dump images and sounds.

This project aims to become a new Clickteam Fusion 2.5 decompiler with much cleaner code than the alternatives coded (mostly) from the ground up, along with MFA reading and CCN writing planned support from the start.

This project will not be updated very often and does not intend to replace CTFAK 2.0. If you'd like to decompile Clickteam Fusion 2.5 games, please use CTFAK 2.0.
