# FusionRipper
A work in progress Clickteam Fusion decompiler.

While only focusing on normal 2.5 games, it can also read MMF 2, TGF 2, and 2.5+. There's code for TGF 1.0 and MMF 1.5, they aren't finished and won't get you anything other than Pack Data.

2.5+ currently is not fully supported for MFA parsing.

This project aims to become a new Clickteam Fusion 2.5 decompiler with much cleaner code than the alternatives coded (mostly) from the ground up, along with MFA reading and CCN writing planned support from the start.
