# SapphireD
A work in progress, reimagining of CTFAK 2.0.
This project is currently unusable for any means.

This project aims to become a new Clickteam Fusion 2.5 decompiler with much cleaner code than the alternatives from the ground up, and with MFA reading and CCN writing planned support from the start.

This project will not be updated very often and does not intend to replace CTFAK 2.0. If you'd like to decompile Clickteam Fusion 2.5 games, please use CTFAK 2.0.
